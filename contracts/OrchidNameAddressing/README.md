# Orchid Name Addressing
> The Orchid Name Addressing (ONA) refernces the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) model and is designed to simplify the complexity of domain and subdomain.


## Design Consideration
> The ONA maintains the same interface functions and events to allow applications that already uses ENS to retrieve address to easily switch to ONA.

> The registration of name is controlled by authorized operators. Users can only register name via the authorized operator. To change operator, user will need to deregister from current operator.

## Future of Work
> The ONA can be extended to allow registration of one registered name to different operators where different addresses can be maintained.
